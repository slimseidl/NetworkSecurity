Star is most common 

	1. Wired Networks
		a. Star
			i. All devices connect back to a central location
				1) To a switch
			ii. Most common today
			
		b. Bus
			i. Linear backbone that all devices connect to
			ii. Has terminal at each end of the spine that terminates the signal so it doesn't reflect
			iii. Hard to determine if there's an issuewhere its coming from
			iv. Coaxial cable runs length of the organization
				1) Access points
			v. Only one device allowed to communicate at a time
				1) Otherwise collision occurs
		c. Ring
			i. Devices connected in a series
			ii. Has to pass through each device onto the next
			iii. If one system goes down, it breaks the ring and all systems are down
			iv. Token ring
				1) Token is passed along the ring to allow communication
					a) Eliminates collisions
				
		d. Mesh / Net
			i. Redundancy
			ii. All devices connected to each other
			iii. No central switch
			iv. Vbery complex and expensive
			v. Mesh can be a good backup to a star
		e. Point to Point
			i. Direct link between two devices
	2. Wireless Networks
		a. Ad Hoc
			i. LAN
			ii. Devices connect to wireless device
			iii. Wireless connects to internet
			iv. Bypass router
		b. Infrastructure Networks
			i. Access Points
				1) Uses different access points to extend and bounce between the same network
