	1. WAN
		a. Wide area network
	2. LAN
		a. Local Area Network
	3. How to conect a Lan to a WAN
	A. Wide Area Networks
		a. Connect systems over a large geographic network
		b. Allow for easier communication
	B. Routers
		a. Device that connects a LAN to a WAN or other networks and exchanges packets of data between them by examining network addresses to determine where to send each packet
		b. Border Routers
			i. Sits between WAN (internet) and an internal network
				1) Subject to direct attack from outside sources
		c. Internal Routers
			i. Departmental router
			ii. Can keep internal networks separate for increased speeds
	C. Local Area Networks
		a. Provide network connectivity for computers that are in the same area
		b. Typically connected with other devices such as:
			i. Hubs
			ii. Switches
			iii. 3 computers to one switch, switch to router, router to internet
		c. Local computers are all connected
			i. Provides a security risk
		d. Ethernet Networking
			i. Ethernet runs to each device
			ii. Ethernet runs back to a switch
			iii. Switch controls a portion of the LAN dedicated to each device
		e. Switches
			i. Connects several systems to the network
			ii. Switches know the MAC address of each device 
				1) Can intelligently filter and sent packets to destination port 
		f. Virtual LANs
			i. Can be branched to only certain areas of the LAN
			ii. Departmentalized
				1) HR
				2) Etc..
	D. WLAN
		a. Same as LAN but wireless protocols
	E. PAN
		a. Personal Area Network
		b. Hotspots / Bluetooth
	F. MAN
		a. Metropolitan area network
		b. Cities
		c. Collection of LANs to a central point
	G. CAN
		a. Campus area network
		b. Multi facility, but not big enough for a metropolitan
	H. SAN 
		a. Storage area networks
		b. Specialized high speed network
		c. Connect to hard drives
