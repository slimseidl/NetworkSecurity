	1. Protection of the service set identifier (SSID)
	2. WLAN issues groups:
		a. Authentication and access control
			i. Authentication should allow sender and reciving signals to verify each other
			ii. Access points use authentication and access control to grant access rights to requesting stations
		b. Encryption and Data Privacy
			i. Transforms plain data into cyphertext (symbols)
	3. Open system authentication (OSA)
		a. No security
		b. Open for all
		c. Uses a key to establish connection
			i. Sending station sends key for receiving station to accept or deny
			ii. Generates a new key to maintain connection
	4. Shared Key authentication
		a. Pairing with randomly generated numbers
	5. Extensible Authentication Methods
		a. EAP
		b. Includes
			i. Passwords
			ii. PKI's (public keys)
			iii. MFA
		c. Three primary areas:
			i. Authentication framework
				1) Login processing
			ii. Authentication algorithm
				1) WPA/WEP Protocols
			iii. Data frame encryption
	6. WEP
		a. Older 
		b. Not used much anymore
	7. WPA2
		a. Older
		b. Preshared Key (PSK)
		c. Uses AES
			i. US Gov standard for encryption
		d. Designed for Home use
		e. Network Username (SSID) and password
			i. Can have different for different frequencies
	8. WPA2 Enterprise
		a. Centralized authentication server at router
		b. Corporate / Offices
		c. Can use a PKI as well
	9. WPA3
		a. Requires new WPA3 hardware
		b. Necryption unique for each user
		c. Uses SAE (simultaneous authentication)
		d. Wifi Easy Connect
			i. Connect devices to wifi
			ii. QR Code
			iii. NCF Tag
			iv. Smart home devices
	10. WPA3 Enterprise
		a. Similar to WPA2
		b. Uses AES
		
	11. WLAN Modes
		a. Ad Hoc
			i. Provides WLAN nodes with the ability to connect to each other in a way similar to peer to peer ops on a wired network
			ii. WMN
				1) Wireless mesh network
				2) Each node connects to every other node in the WLAN
				3) Each node is IBSS
					a) Independent basic service set
						i) Provides access to a wired network, modem connection or other services depending in permissions
		b. Infrastructure Mode
			i. Most common for larger WLANs
			ii. Requires at least one base station
			iii. Usually connected to a WAN network / gateway
			iv. BSS topology
				1) Basic service set
					a) Wireless connects to access point
						i) Acces point to switch or router
							One. Router to WAN
		c. ESS
			i. Extended service set
				1) Larger networks that provide coverage to a large area
			ii. Multiple wireless access points
			iii. Multiple routers
			iv. All go to a WAN
