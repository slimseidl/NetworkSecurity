• Key sections to focus on: Pay special attention to the sections detailing firewalls, their types, functions, and roles in network security. These areas are fundamental to understanding network security infrastructure.

	1. A firewall controls the flow of traffic by preventing unauthorized traffic from entering or leaving a particular segment of the network
	2. Separate private networks from the internet or from each other
	3. Firewalls set up with a logic of rules
	4. Flood Guards
		a. Limit traffic from hosts
		b. Reduce the risk of flooding the network
	5. Loop protection
		a. Terminate infinite loops
	6. Network segmentation
		a. Separation between networks
		b. Keep traffic from moving from one network to another
	7. Firewall types
		a. Packet Filtering
			i. Compares traffic with a set of rules that define which traffic can pass through
			ii. No memory of past packets
		b. Stateful inspection
			i. Stores memory 
			ii. Only needs to check rules when a new communication session starts rather than every time it receives a packet
		c. Application Proxy
			i. Doesn’t allow packets to travel between systems of opposite sides of the firewall
			ii. Opens separate connections and acts as a broker (proxy) between the two transmissions. 
	8. Firewall deployment techniques
		a. Border Firewall
			i. Separates network from the internet
			ii. Behind a router
			iii. Good for organizations that block all outside sources
		b. Screened Subnet
			i. Allows inbound connections on a limited basis
				1) Companies with public websites 
			ii. Most common today
			iii. DMZ system
		c. Multilayered 
			i. Highly secure environments
			ii. Useful when networks in an organization have different security levels
		d. Stateless
		e. Proxy server
			i. Make a request to the firewall, then firewalls makes its own request to the internet
			ii. Examines responses back for malware or other malicious attempts
	9. Unified threat management
		a. URL filters
		b. Content inspection
		c. Malware inspection
	10. VPNs (virtual private networks)
		a. Remote access
		b. Allows for access to company resources across the public internet network
		c. Increases security of data being transmitted across the public data network
		d. Uses encryption
