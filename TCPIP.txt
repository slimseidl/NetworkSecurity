Layers of TCP / IP Model
	4. Process Or Application Layer
		a. SMTP, HTTP, File Transfer protocols
		b. Communication protocols between layers
		c. SSH
		d. Dynamic host configuration (DHCP)
		e. IMAP (internet message access)
		f. FTP (file transfer)
		g. Post office protocol
		h. Encryption 
	3. Host to Host or Transport Layer
		a. Provides reliable transport to provide numbering of services thru port numbering
		b. End to end transport of data
		c. Protocols:
			i. TCP
			ii. UDP
		d. Data arrives in same state as was sent
		e. Missing data is retransmitted
		f. Duplicate data is dropped
		g. Network path problems are handled
	2. Internet Layer / Networking
		a. Logical addressing and routing, IP, ICMP
		b. ARP protocol
		c. Sends packets across networks
		d. Makes routing decisions
	3. Network Access or Link Layer
		a. Network Access protocols
		b. Hardware to provide networking
		c. Ensure packets move between nodes in the same LAN
		

*Same networking concepts as OSI model, but groups together application, presentation and session into one layer under application
*Only 4 Layers instead of 7
